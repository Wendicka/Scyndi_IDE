# Scyndi_IDE

IDE for Scyndi, like the name suggests...
This will just be a very simplistic IDE which can run on both Mac and Windows, and although it should be possible to write it in Scyndi, I will for now write it in BlitzMax, as this is only a small IDE that has to serve me for the time being, that I had to whip up quickly. When things are fully in motion, I'd rather use existing professionally set up IDEs, anyway, and if you wanna set up something better... Well, don't be a stranger.

NOTE: This is a work in progress, so don't expect to see anything useful until this notice has been removed.
